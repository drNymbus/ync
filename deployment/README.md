# YNS Deployment

All yaml files to start and shutdown the Young New Service.

To set the default namespace: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<my-namespace || default>`

## ync-database

- `database.yaml`: Describes the StatefulSet and Service for the Cassandra node.
- `storage.yaml`: Describe the Persistent Volume to set and the Persistent Volume Claim to be used by the StatefulSet.
- `inspector.yaml`: The only purpose of the resource is to monitor the Persistent Volume directly; this also is used to entirely delete the Persistent Volume if needed (see the "delete" section in the "service.sh" bash script).

The job folder contains every different jobs ran against the StatefulSet, those scripts are able to run only if the Cassandra node is fully initialized.

## ync-api & ync-app

Each yaml file should contain a Deployment resource to run the API/App with the service associated so that other resources can reach the API/App. sTo deploy an internal service use ClusterIP.

Weird thing about ync-app/shop-app the service needs to be aware of the external router IP to run properly; is there a better way of doing this env var stuff ? Is it possible to automatize ? It also seems the only way to properly serve the client side with the correct address.

# Credentials

For the APIs and Applications to be able to connect to the Cassandra cluster we use a Username-Password authentication. Those credentials are stored thanks to kubernetes Secrets resources, then fetched from environment variables in APIs and Applications.

# Bash scripting

- `service.sh`: Every comand needed to start, stop, update, scale and delete the entire service.

- `build.sh`: Creates all docker images needed to run the entire service. (An option can be given to register images in a k3s cluster)

We will switch to [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) and [Apache airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-go) in Go to handle the CI/CD loop and kubernetes resources

# Kubernetes (k8s)

Many installation tools can be used. In first place, Minikube was chosen for a minimal installation for development purposes, where a lot of network functionality aren’t built the same as in a full scale model. We are currently running on a i5, 7Go RAM, 2To PC. A limited ram setup and also a single unite made us look directly to k3s

## Install

Before installing anything you will need a Daemon running, if you are running something else than Docker, you may need to specify it during some commands throughout this guide.

***Minikube***:

- OSX: `brew install minikube`
- Linux:

```bash
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64\ && chmod +x minikube
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Since Minikube handles only the node configuration, you’ll need to install `kubectl` independently: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

***k3s***:

```bash
curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io/) | sh -
```

Check for Ready node, takes ~30 seconds:`sudo k3s kubectl get node`  

## Minikube

To run this locally, you'll first need to have a minikube working (some help can be found in the 'deployment' folder of this repository). You can deploy all components thanks to the 'deployment/start.sh' bash file in a single command line! If you wish to get deeper explanations of each component deployment, go to the 'deployment' folder of this repository.

You can find all commands needed to start the entire YNC service in the bash files './start.sh' and './shutdown.sh'; All components are under the same namespace: ync. If you want to deploy locally the all service you'll need docker and minikube installed.

```bash
systemctl start dockerd # Ensure that docker daemon is running
minikube start
```

To be able to deploy local docker images, you'll need to configure your minikube cluster to use the docker-env, for UNIX users this would be:

```bash
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

And for DOS users, you'll need to use Powershell:

```powershell
minikube -p minikube docker-env --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression
```

(In case this command fails, try removing 'minikube -p')

For all services to be able to work properly on a local setting, you'll need to run on a separate terminal (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#using-minikube-tunnel):

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

Once your minikube is set up, you'll be able to run the bash file 'start.sh'. To delete all ync-app resources without effort, execute 'shutdown.sh' file.

## k3s

If you wish to go deeper: https://docs.k3s.io/

- **START**: `sudo systemctl start k3s`
- **STOP**:  `sudo systemctl stop k3s`
- **RESET ENV**:  `sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-killall.sh`

## Scaling

(What’s next also applies to Deployments, to a certain extent)

## Use kubectl to scale StatefulSets

1. First, find the StatefulSet you want to scale: `kubectl get statefulsets <stateful-set-name>`
2. Change the number of replicas of your StatefulSet: `kubectl scale statefulsets <stateful-set-name> --replicas=<new-replicas>`

## Make in-place updates on your StatefulSets

Alternatively, you can do [in-place updates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#in-place-updates-of-resources) on your StatefulSets.

If your StatefulSet was initially created with `kubectl apply`, update `.spec.replicas` of the StatefulSet manifests, and then do a `kubectl apply`: 

`kubectl apply -f <stateful-set-file-updated>`

Otherwise, edit that field with `kubectl edit`:

`kubectl edit statefulsets <stateful-set-name>`

Or use `kubectl patch`:

`kubectl patch statefulsets <stateful-set-name> -p '{"spec":{"replicas":<new-replicas>}}'`
